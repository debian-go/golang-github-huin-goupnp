Description: UPnP library for Go (#golang)
 goupnp is a UPnP client library for Go Installation Run go get -u
 github.com/huin/goupnp.  Documentation All doc links below are for GoDoc.
 .
 Supported DCPs (you probably want to start with one of these):
 * av1 (https://godoc.org/github.com/huin/goupnp/dcps/av1) -
 Client for UPnP Device Control Protocol MediaServer
 v1 and MediaRenderer v1.  * internetgateway1
 (https://godoc.org/github.com/huin/goupnp/dcps/internetgateway1)
 - Client for UPnP Device Control Protocol
 Internet Gateway Device v1.  * internetgateway2
 (https://godoc.org/github.com/huin/goupnp/dcps/internetgateway2) -
 Client for UPnP Device Control Protocol Internet Gateway Device v2.
 .
 Core components: * (goupnp) (https://godoc.org/github.com/huin/goupnp)
 core library - contains datastructures and utilities
 typically used by the implemented DCPs.  * httpu
 (https://godoc.org/github.com/huin/goupnp/httpu) HTTPU implementation,
 underlies SSDP.  * ssdp (https://godoc.org/github.com/huin/goupnp/ssdp)
 SSDP client implementation (simple service discovery
 protocol) - used to discover UPnP services on a network.  * soap
 (https://godoc.org/github.com/huin/goupnp/soap) SOAP client implementation
 (simple object access protocol) - used to communicate with discovered
 services.  Regenerating dcps generated source code:• Install gotasks:
 go get -u github.com/jingweno/gotask• Change to the gotasks directory:
 cd gotasks• Run specgen task: gotask specgenSupporting additional UPnP
 devices and services: Supporting additional services is, in the trivial
 case, simply a matter of adding the service to the dcpMetadata whitelist
 in gotasks/specgen_task.go, regenerating the source code (see above),
 and committing that source code.
 .
 However, it would be helpful if anyone needing such a service
 could test the service against the service they have, and then
 reporting any trouble encountered as an issue on this project
 (https://github.com/huin/goupnp/issues/new). If it just works, then
 please report at least minimal working functionality as an issue, and
 optionally contribute the metadata upstream.
